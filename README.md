# Customer-Segmentation-Practice_Clustering-ML-
Here I  implementated the K-Means algorithm in Python on the Online Retail case study for Customer Segmentation. 

**Steps Involved:**
1. Importing Libraries
2. Loading and Analysing the DATA
3. Data Cleaning & Manipulation
4. Handling Outliers
5. Handling Null Values
6. Modelling 
7. Model Evaluation

**Inferences:**
1. Optimal Number CLusters were 3   with best Silhouette Score =0.54

2. Cluster 3 has a wide distribution of data  points 

3. Cluster 0 represents High-value Customers who Spends a lot and have high recency. 

4. Cluster 2 represents Low Valued customers who spend less and who visit less and places fewer orders.
